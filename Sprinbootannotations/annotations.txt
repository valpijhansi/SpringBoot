    @Autowired:
                Spring provides annotation-based auto-wiring by @Autowired annotation.
                It is used to autowire spring bean on setter methods,insatnce variable, and constructor.
                When we sue @Autowired annotation,  the spring container auto-wires the bean by matching data-type.
    @Configuration:
                It is a class level annotation.The class annotated with @Configuration used by Spring Containers as a source of bean definitions.

    @ComponentScan:
                It is used to scan a package for bean.
                we can also specify the base package to scan for spring Components.

    @Bean:
        It is Method-level annotation.
        It is an alternative ofXML<bean> tag.
        It tells method to produce a bean to be managed by spring container.  

    @Component: 
                It is a class-level annotation. 
                It is used to mark a Java class as a bean. 
                A Java class annotated with @Component is found during the classpath. 
                The Spring Framework pick it up and configure it in the application context as a Spring Bean.            

    @Service: 
                It is also used at class level. 
                It tells the Spring that class contains the business logic. 

    @Repository: 
                It is a class-level annotation. 
                The repository is a DAOs (Data Access Object) that access the database directly. 
                The repository does all the operations related to the database.      

    @EnableAutoConfiguration: 
                            It auto-configures the bean that is present in the classpath and configures it to run the methods. 
                            The use of this annotation is reduced in Spring Boot 1.2.0 release because developers provided an alternative of the annotation, i.e. @SpringBootApplication.
    @SpringBootApplication:
                            It is a combination of three annotations @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan, and @Configuration
